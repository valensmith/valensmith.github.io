## progress update

I was putting all my results into a presentable form and running through them to check that they work when I realised that duck duck go search isn't working which makes me very stressed as I'm not sure how long it will take to fix. I've liked this assignment so far but this seems quite unreasonable that a question could be solved one day then broken the next. Are we expected to constantly be check that all our questions work when we only have limitted core hours that we can run out code on? will make an update to this if I figure out a solution
