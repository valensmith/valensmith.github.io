## progress update

using a notebook on the kaggle website, I've been able to create a model much more easily as the photo files are already there. Using Resnet-18, an accuracy of 98.2% has been achieved. It took about 40 minutes to create this model but initially it would have taken around 12 hours but I realised something was wrong after the first attempt when something felt off. I hadn't turned the GPU's on but once that was done everything happened a lot quicker.
